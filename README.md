# Sylabs
This work was a team project consisting of a full rework of Sylabs Incubator's website, based on a study conducted on on a sample of +35 users as well as our own observations.<br>
The prototype website is functionnal and can be viewed at: https://dregonhive.github.io/Sylabs/ <br>
A tiny backend server (merely sending confirmation emails to fully implement the UX map) is deployed on glitch.
